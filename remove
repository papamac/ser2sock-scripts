# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The remove script removes all ser2sock and ser2sock-scripts files from the
# current working directory and /etc.  It also stops the ser2sock daemon and
# disables/deletes the daemon unit files.
#
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage is as follows:
#
# sudo p2pkg -r ser2sock-scripts        # Remove the ser2sock and ser2sock-
#                                         scripts files/directories from the
#                                         current working directory and /etc;
#                                         stop the daemon and disable/delete
#                                         the daemon unit files.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be
# executed using sudo.
