# DESCRIPTION:                                                                #

# The remove script removes all ser2sock and ser2sock-scripts files from the  #
# current working directory.  It also stops/disables the ser2sock daemon and  #
# deletes the daemon unit files.                                              #
#                                                                             #
# remove is designed to be used with p2pkg.  Usage is as follows:             #
#                                                                             #
# sudo p2pkg -r ser2sock-scripts        # Remove the ser2sock and ser2sock-   #
#                                         scripts files/directories from the  #
#                                         current working directory; stop/    #
#                                         disable the daemon and delete the   #
#                                         daemon unit files.                  #
#                                                                             #
#                                                                             #
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:                                                   #
#                                                                             #
# Because it changes files and directories owned by root, p2pkg -r must be    #
# executed using sudo.                                                        #
#                                                                             #
