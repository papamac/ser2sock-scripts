# DESCRIPTION:                                                                #
#
# The option script installs, enables, and starts the ser2sock daemon unit file
# (ser2sock.service) that has already been downloaded to the src sub-directory
# of the current working directory (src/ser2sock).
#
# Before starting, option checks to see if the ser2sock package has been
# installed.  If not, it aborts the option execution.  If so, option copies
# the daemon unit file (src/ser2sock/ser2sockd.service) to a user library on
# the systemd search path (/usr/local/lib/systemd/system).  It then edits the
# unit file in place to reference the current working directory in the
# executable command line.  Finally, option enables the unit file and restarts
# the daemon using the systemd systemctl utility.
#
# option is designed to be used with papamac's personal package utility
# (p2pkg).  The following example downloads ser2sock (p2pkg -G), downloads the
# ser2sock-scripts (p2pkg -g), builds/installs the executable (p2pkg -i), and
# installs/enables/starts the daemon (p2pkg -o):
#
# cd /usr/local                                    # Use usr/local directory.
# sudo p2pkg -b V1.3.1 -G nutechsoftware ser2sock  # Download Nu Tech's
#                                                    V1.3.1 ser2sock package to
#                                                    /usr/local/src/ser2sock.
# sudo p2pkg -gio ser2sock-scripts                 # Download papamac's
#                                                    ser2sock-scripts to
#                                                    /usr/local/src/ser2sock-scripts,
#                                                    build/install ser2sock
#                                                    in /usr/local/bin, and
#                                                    install/enable/restart the
#                                                    ser2sock daemon using
#                                                    systemctl.
#
#
# DEPENDENCIES/LIMITATIONS:
#
# option must be run using sudo because it copies and edits files in the root-
# owned directory /usr/local/lib/systemd/system.
