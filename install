# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The Serial to Socket Relay (ser2sock) is a program written by Sean Mathews of
# Nu Tech Software Solutions, Inc. to relay data from a serial port to one or
# or more socket connections.  ser2sock is used by papamac's AlarmDecoder-
# Bridge package to access serial data from Nu Tech's AD2USB or AD2PI.  Nu
# Tech's ser2sock package is located at github.com/nutechsoftware/ser2sock.
# This package must be downloaded to the src sub-directory of the current
# working directory (src/ser2sock) prior to running install.
#
# Before starting, install checks to see if the the Nu Tech ser2sock package
# already been downloaded.  If not, it aborts the installation.  If so, install
# builds the ser2sock executable in the src/ser2sock directory and then copies
# it to the bin sub-directory of the current working directory.  It also copies
# papamac's version of the ser2sock.conf file to /etc/ser2sock.
#
# install does not install or start the ser2sock daemon.  Use the option script
# to do this after the install is complete.
#
# install is designed to be used with papamac's personal package utility
# (p2pkg).  First the Nu Tech ser2sock package is downloaded to src/ser2sock
# (p2pkg -G).  Next papamac's ser2sock-scripts package is downloaded into
# src/ser2sock-scripts (p2pkg -g) and install (p2pkg -i) is run.  An example
# follows:
#
# cd /usr/local                         # Use the usr/local directory.
# sudo p2pkg -G nutechsoftware ser2sock # Download Nu Tech's ser2sock package
#                                         to /usr/local/src/ser2sock.
# sudo p2pkg -gi ser2sock-scripts       # Download papamac's ser2sock-scripts
#                                         to /usr/local/src/ser2sock-scripts,
#                                         build/install ser2sock in
#                                         /usr/local/bin, and copy
#                                         ser2sock.conf to /etc/ser2sock.
