#
# DESCRIPTION:
#
# The Serial to Socket Relay (ser2sock) is a program written by Sean Mathews of
# Nu Tech Software Solutions, Inc. to relay data from a serial port to one or
# or more socket connections.  ser2sock is used by papamac's AlarmDecoder-
# Bridge package to access serial data from Nu Tech's AD2USB or AD2PI.
#
# Nu Tech's ser2sock package is located at github.com/nutechsoftware/ser2sock.
# The current ser2sock version (master branch v1.5.5), implements the Secure
# Socket Layer (SSL) protocol for all socket connections.  This feature,
# although desirable, creates a lot of complexity in building a ser2sock
# executable.  The github build scripts for v1.5.5 seem to be incompatible with
# the tools provided by current Raspberry Pi OS bookworm distribution.  To
# maintain compatibility across various Raspberry Pi distributions, this
# install script requires the non-SSL ser2sock V1.3.1 that can be compiled
# easily without SSL libraries.  This works because papamac's AlarmDecoder-
# Bridge application does not require SSL.
#
# Before starting, install checks to see if the the Nu Tech ser2sock package
# already been downloaded.  If not, it aborts the installation.  If so, install
# builds the ser2sock executable in the src/ser2sock directory and then copies
# it to the bin sub-directory of the current working directory.  install does
# not install or start a ser2sock daemon.  Use the option script to do this
# after install is complete.
#
# install is designed to be used with papamac's personal package utility
# (p2pkg).  First the Nu Tech ser2sock package (V1.3.1) is downloaded to
# src/ser2sock (p2pkg -G).  Next papamac's ser2sock-scripts package is
# downloaded into src/ser2sock-scripts (p2pkg -g) and install (p2pkg -i) is
# run.  An example follows:
#
# cd /usr/local                                    # Use usr/local directory.
# sudo p2pkg -b V1.3.1 -G nutechsoftware ser2sock  # Download Nu Tech's
#                                                    V1.3.1 ser2sock package to
#                                                    /usr/local/src/ser2sock.
# sudo p2pkg -gi ser2sock-scripts                  # Download papamac's
#                                                    ser2sock-scripts to
#                                                    /usr/local/src/ser2sock-scripts,
#                                                    and build/install ser2sock
#                                                    in /usr/local/bin.
